        <p style="background-color: gold;"><i>The rotary dial phone</i> was invented in 1919 by Almon Brown Strowger. For many decades if you wanted to
            make a call somewhere you would have to be patched through by an operator. To make a call you would crank a
            handle and a light would appear on the operatorâ€™s panel. They would then ask for the destination of where you want
            to call and then patch you through. This was rather inefficient and during the war priority of the network
            went to the military and emergency services, and civilians could have to wait up to 2 hours for their calls
            to be connected. Inventors were trying to find ways to cut out the middleman. Strowger design used lugs on
            the disk instead of the holes that we are used to. Each hole corresponds with a number and sometimes
            letters. To dial the number that they wanted the caller would insert their finger into the hole with the
            corresponding number and rotate it until they heard a click. They would remove their finger and the dial
            would reset itself for the next number. The rotary phone worked by recording the number dialed as electrical
            pulses. The shaft of the dial would open and close a switch contact. When the contact is open it cuts off
            the current thereby making a pulse. When the contact was closed the current was a constant flow. The pulses
            were sent to an electromechanical switching office and they were recorded there. The pulses would be decoded
            to find the number that the caller dialed and then they would be connected to the call. </p>
