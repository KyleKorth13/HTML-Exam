        <p style="background-color: aqua;">The first <i>touch tone telephone</i> was introduced in Pennsylvania on November 16, 1963. Using DTMF
            technology (dual tone multi frequency), the <i>touch tone telephone</i> would become the standard for
            telecommunicating worldwide. The touch tone system uses audible tone to represent each digit on the push
            button keypad. Certain specific frequencies were given to each row of the columns and rows. When one of the
            buttons is pressed it makes a combination signal of the frequency from the row and the frequency from the
            column. This is why it is called dual tone multi frequency signaling. The tones are then decoded to find out
            which digit had been pressed. With the rotary dial telephone operators were still required in order to make
            a long distance call. Thanks to the <i>touch tone telephone</i> callers could now directly call the desired
            telephone number without needing to talk with the telephone operator first. The first <i>touch tone
                telephone</i> had a total of 10 buttons. There were 15 different layouts of the keys that were tested
            before engineers settled on the top left being the one and the zero being in the bottom row. The <i>touch
                tone telephone</i> used mechanical switches to chose different taps on tuned coils. The microphone was
            disconnected as the button was pressed so that the noise could not interfere with the transmission of the
            DTMF tones. The idea for the <i>touch tone telephone</i> came before the invention of the rotary dial
            telephone but took a while to happen. <i>Touch tone telephones</i> weren’t in most US houses until the
            1980’s. </p>
