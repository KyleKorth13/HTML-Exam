        <p style="background-color:darkorange;">The <i>cordless phone</i> was invented by George Sweigert in 1980. The <i>cordless phone</i> is a combination
            of a telephone and a radio receiver/transmitter. It consists of two major part, the base, and the handset.
            The base is connected to the phone jack with the standard phone wire connection. The base is what receives
            the call. It receives it through the phone line as an electrical signal and then it converts the electrical
            signal into a FM radio signal. The radio signal is then broadcasted. The handset is what receives the radio
            signal that the base broadcasted. The handset then converts the radio signal back into an electrical signal
            which it sends to the speaker and is converted into the sound that you can hear. When you talk the handset
            transmits your voice on a different FM radio signal to the base. When it receives the radio signal it
            converts to an electrical signal and sends it to the other party through the phone line. The handset and the
            base work on a pair of frequencies that allow you to speak and listen at the same time. The is called a
            duplex frequency. The frequencies that <i>cordless phones</i> were given to work on changed around a lot the
            first <i>cordless phones</i> started at a frequency of 27 MHz. The frequency was changed to 47-49 MHz which
            reduced interference in 1986. In 1990 it was changed to 900MHz which allowed phones to be clearer and
            transmit farther. In 1998 it was changed to 2.4 GHz which further increased it range and improved the
            security. </p>
