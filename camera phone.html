        <p style="background-color: teal;">The first <i>camera phone</i>was created by Phillipe Khan in 1997. There have been many versions of the
            <i>camera phone</i> built. The SCH-V200 was a cell phone with a built-in camera made by Samsung. It was able
            to take up to 20 photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. However, to get your photos you had to connect the
            phone to the computer. The phone and camera were basically two completely separate devices within a single
            body. The J-SH04 could take photos at 110,000-pixel resolution but unlike the SCH-V200 it was able to send
            photos electronically. The first US <i>camera phone</i> was the Sanyo SCP-5300. It was able to take pictures
            at 640x480 pixels. It also had many features like flash, zoom, a self-timer, and a few different filters. By
            2003 over 80 million <i>camera phones</i> had been sold worldwide. The PM8920 could capture shots at
            1280x960 pixels resolution. The pictures were good enough to print off and it had a feature where you could
            take eight quick pictures in a row. Samsung was the first to make a 5-megapixel <i>camera phone</i> but
            Nokiaâ€™s N95 was the first popular one. It had a Carl Zeiss lens and took great photos and could record a
            video at a rate of 30 frames per second. In 2008 Nokia released the first 8-megapixel <i>camera phone</i>
            that had a touchscreen that was called the LG Renoir. <i>Camera phones</i> kept improving their megapixel
            count as Sony made the first 16-megapixel <i>camera phone</i>. The improvement of <i>camera phones</i> was
            slowed down by the iPhone. It showed that there were other features than were more important than the
            camera. Also, the <i>camera phones</i> were big and chunky while iPhones were slim and attractive. </p>
