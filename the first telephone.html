        <p style="background-color: darksalmon;"><i>The first telephone</i> was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Bell was trying to improve the
            telegraph which led him to the telephone. The telegraph was only able to send one message at a time, but
            Bell wanted to send more than one message one the same wire simultaneously. In the summer of 1874 Bell
            changed his goal from sending multiple messages to transmitting the human voice electrically. He and his
            assistant Mr. Watson found that different tones resulted in different strengths of an electrical current in
            a wire. The next thing they had to do was create a device to convert the tones into electrical currents and
            a receiver that was able to convert the varying currents back into sound on the other end. Their
            breakthrough came when they used what Bell called a liquid transmitter. It was a metal cone with some
            parchment was stretched over the narrow end toward the base almost like a drum. Outside the parchment was a
            cork with a needle stuck in it and was pointing into a small cup of sulphuric acid. When he spoke into the
            cone the parchment vibrated and the needle slightly moved in relation to a contact that was inside the cup.
            The needle had been wired to a battery and the movement of the needle varied the strength of the current
            that was passing between the contacts. This is how soundwaves were converted into electrical signals and
            then sent to a receiver over a wire. Using this device Bell sent the first phone call saying, “Mr. Watson,
            come here, I want to see you.” </p>
