        <p><i>The first telephone</i> was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Bell was trying to improve the
            telegraph which led him to the telephone. The telegraph was only able to send one message at a time, but
            Bell wanted to send more than one message one the same wire simultaneously. In the summer of 1874 Bell
            changed his goal from sending multiple messages to transmitting the human voice electrically. He and his
            assistant Mr. Watson found that different tones resulted in different strengths of an electrical current in
            a wire. The next thing they had to do was create a device to convert the tones into electrical currents and
            a receiver that was able to convert the varying currents back into sound on the other end. Their
            breakthrough came when they used what Bell called a liquid transmitter. It was a metal cone with some
            parchment was stretched over the narrow end toward the base almost like a drum. Outside the parchment was a
            cork with a needle stuck in it and was pointing into a small cup of sulphuric acid. When he spoke into the
            cone the parchment vibrated and the needle slightly moved in relation to a contact that was inside the cup.
            The needle had been wired to a battery and the movement of the needle varied the strength of the current
            that was passing between the contacts. This is how soundwaves were converted into electrical signals and
            then sent to a receiver over a wire. Using this device Bell sent the first phone call saying, “Mr. Watson,
            come here, I want to see you.” </p>

        <p><i>The rotary dial phone</i> was invented in 1919 by Almon Brown Strowger. For many decades if you wanted to make a
            call somewhere you would have to be patched through by an operator. To make a call you would crank a handle
            and a light would appear on the operator’s panel. They would then ask for the destination of where you want
            to call and then patch you through. This was rather inefficient and during the war priority of the network
            went to the military and emergency services, and civilians could have to wait up to 2 hours for their calls
            to be connected. Inventors were trying to find ways to cut out the middleman. Strowger design used lugs on
            the disk instead of the holes that we are used to. Each hole corresponds with a number and sometimes
            letters. To dial the number that they wanted the caller would insert their finger into the hole with the
            corresponding number and rotate it until they heard a click. They would remove their finger and the dial
            would reset itself for the next number. The rotary phone worked by recording the number dialed as electrical
            pulses. The shaft of the dial would open and close a switch contact. When the contact is open it cuts off
            the current thereby making a pulse. When the contact was closed the current was a constant flow. The pulses
            were sent to an electromechanical switching office and they were recorded there. The pulses would be decoded
            to find the number that the caller dialed and then they would be connected to the call. </p>
