        <p style="background-color: darksalmon;"><i>The first telephone</i> was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Bell was trying to improve the
            telegraph which led him to the telephone. The telegraph was only able to send one message at a time, but
            Bell wanted to send more than one message one the same wire simultaneously. In the summer of 1874 Bell
            changed his goal from sending multiple messages to transmitting the human voice electrically. He and his
            assistant Mr. Watson found that different tones resulted in different strengths of an electrical current in
            a wire. The next thing they had to do was create a device to convert the tones into electrical currents and
            a receiver that was able to convert the varying currents back into sound on the other end. Their
            breakthrough came when they used what Bell called a liquid transmitter. It was a metal cone with some
            parchment was stretched over the narrow end toward the base almost like a drum. Outside the parchment was a
            cork with a needle stuck in it and was pointing into a small cup of sulphuric acid. When he spoke into the
            cone the parchment vibrated and the needle slightly moved in relation to a contact that was inside the cup.
            The needle had been wired to a battery and the movement of the needle varied the strength of the current
            that was passing between the contacts. This is how soundwaves were converted into electrical signals and
            then sent to a receiver over a wire. Using this device Bell sent the first phone call saying, “Mr. Watson,
            come here, I want to see you.” </p>

        <p style="background-color: gold;"><i>The rotary dial phone</i> was invented in 1919 by Almon Brown Strowger. For many decades if you wanted to
            make a call somewhere you would have to be patched through by an operator. To make a call you would crank a
            handle and a light would appear on the operator’s panel. They would then ask for the destination of where you want
            to call and then patch you through. This was rather inefficient and during the war priority of the network
            went to the military and emergency services, and civilians could have to wait up to 2 hours for their calls
            to be connected. Inventors were trying to find ways to cut out the middleman. Strowger design used lugs on
            the disk instead of the holes that we are used to. Each hole corresponds with a number and sometimes
            letters. To dial the number that they wanted the caller would insert their finger into the hole with the
            corresponding number and rotate it until they heard a click. They would remove their finger and the dial
            would reset itself for the next number. The rotary phone worked by recording the number dialed as electrical
            pulses. The shaft of the dial would open and close a switch contact. When the contact is open it cuts off
            the current thereby making a pulse. When the contact was closed the current was a constant flow. The pulses
            were sent to an electromechanical switching office and they were recorded there. The pulses would be decoded
            to find the number that the caller dialed and then they would be connected to the call. </p>

        <p style="background-color: aqua;">The first <i>touch tone telephone</i> was introduced in Pennsylvania on November 16, 1963. Using DTMF
            technology (dual tone multi frequency), the <i>touch tone telephone</i> would become the standard for
            telecommunicating worldwide. The touch tone system uses audible tone to represent each digit on the push
            button keypad. Certain specific frequencies were given to each row of the columns and rows. When one of the
            buttons is pressed it makes a combination signal of the frequency from the row and the frequency from the
            column. This is why it is called dual tone multi frequency signaling. The tones are then decoded to find out
            which digit had been pressed. With the rotary dial telephone operators were still required in order to make
            a long distance call. Thanks to the <i>touch tone telephone</i> callers could now directly call the desired
            telephone number without needing to talk with the telephone operator first. The first <i>touch tone
                telephone</i> had a total of 10 buttons. There were 15 different layouts of the keys that were tested
            before engineers settled on the top left being the one and the zero being in the bottom row. The <i>touch
                tone telephone</i> used mechanical switches to chose different taps on tuned coils. The microphone was
            disconnected as the button was pressed so that the noise could not interfere with the transmission of the
            DTMF tones. The idea for the <i>touch tone telephone</i> came before the invention of the rotary dial
            telephone but took a while to happen. <i>Touch tone telephones</i> weren’t in most US houses until the
            1980’s. </p>

        <p style="background-color:darkorange;">The <i>cordless phone</i> was invented by George Sweigert in 1980. The <i>cordless phone</i> is a combination
            of a telephone and a radio receiver/transmitter. It consists of two major part, the base, and the handset.
            The base is connected to the phone jack with the standard phone wire connection. The base is what receives
            the call. It receives it through the phone line as an electrical signal and then it converts the electrical
            signal into a FM radio signal. The radio signal is then broadcasted. The handset is what receives the radio
            signal that the base broadcasted. The handset then converts the radio signal back into an electrical signal
            which it sends to the speaker and is converted into the sound that you can hear. When you talk the handset
            transmits your voice on a different FM radio signal to the base. When it receives the radio signal it
            converts to an electrical signal and sends it to the other party through the phone line. The handset and the
            base work on a pair of frequencies that allow you to speak and listen at the same time. The is called a
            duplex frequency. The frequencies that <i>cordless phones</i> were given to work on changed around a lot the
            first <i>cordless phones</i> started at a frequency of 27 MHz. The frequency was changed to 47-49 MHz which
            reduced interference in 1986. In 1990 it was changed to 900MHz which allowed phones to be clearer and
            transmit farther. In 1998 it was changed to 2.4 GHz which further increased it range and improved the
            security. </p>

        <p style="background-color: teal;">The first <i>camera phone</i>was created by Phillipe Khan in 1997. There have been many versions of the
            <i>camera phone</i> built. The SCH-V200 was a cell phone with a built-in camera made by Samsung. It was able
            to take up to 20 photos at 350,000-pixel resolution. However, to get your photos you had to connect the
            phone to the computer. The phone and camera were basically two completely separate devices within a single
            body. The J-SH04 could take photos at 110,000-pixel resolution but unlike the SCH-V200 it was able to send
            photos electronically. The first US <i>camera phone</i> was the Sanyo SCP-5300. It was able to take pictures
            at 640x480 pixels. It also had many features like flash, zoom, a self-timer, and a few different filters. By
            2003 over 80 million <i>camera phones</i> had been sold worldwide. The PM8920 could capture shots at
            1280x960 pixels resolution. The pictures were good enough to print off and it had a feature where you could
            take eight quick pictures in a row. Samsung was the first to make a 5-megapixel <i>camera phone</i> but
            Nokia’s N95 was the first popular one. It had a Carl Zeiss lens and took great photos and could record a
            video at a rate of 30 frames per second. In 2008 Nokia released the first 8-megapixel <i>camera phone</i>
            that had a touchscreen that was called the LG Renoir. <i>Camera phones</i> kept improving their megapixel
            count as Sony made the first 16-megapixel <i>camera phone</i>. The improvement of <i>camera phones</i> was
            slowed down by the iPhone. It showed that there were other features than were more important than the
            camera. Also, the <i>camera phones</i> were big and chunky while iPhones were slim and attractive. </p>
